# Essential Tremor Purkinje Model
Model of purkinje cell dendritic loss as seen experimentally in essential tremor pathology

Placeholder currently

Outline: 
  1) create detailed purkinje model with dendrites, using historical models as a base such as those shown [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1426653/full), using [Brian2](https://briansimulator.org/) and/or [Dendrify](https://github.com/Poirazi-Lab/dendrify)
  2) Compare spike time patterns and spiking statistics of the output of a full model to a model with dendrite loss of the same average percentage of purkinje cells [seen in essential tremor pathology](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu314)

![Figure from Louis, et al 10.1093/brain/awu314, showing images of a purkinje cell with complex branches from an unaffected brain next to a purkinje cell from an ET brain with significant dendrite degeneration. There are also simplified drawings of the cells, illustrating the differences in branch structure in control vs ET purkinje cells](https://github.com/axoaxonic/EssentialTremorPurkinjeModel/blob/main/Images/LouisEtAlPurkinjeDegenET.png?raw=true)
