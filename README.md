# Essential Tremor Purkinje Model
Model of purkinje cell dendritic loss as seen experimentally in essential tremor pathology

Placeholder currently

Outline: 
  1) create detailed purkinje model with dendrites, using historical models as a base such as those shown [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1426653/full), using [Brian2](https://briansimulator.org/) and/or [Dendrify](https://github.com/Poirazi-Lab/dendrify)
  2) Compare spike time patterns and spiking statistics of the output of a full model to a model with dendrite loss of the same average percentage of purkinje cells [seen in essential tremor pathology](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu314)
